We will be looking at some regression diagnostics

a. Start by fitting a linear regression model using the `mtcars` data set. `mpg` as the response and `wt` as the predictor. Create a scatter plot of `mpg` and `wt` and plot the linear model fit on top. Explain how well you think the fit looks.
b. `plot()` the regression model you created to look at the diagnostic plots. Explain what you see.
c. Use `rstudent()` to get the studentized residuals and plot them. Do you see any trends or outliers?
d. Use the `shapiro.test()` to test for Normality of the studentized residuals. Comment on the results.
