### Data

[presidents.csv](data/presidents.csv)

[USpop.csv](data/USpop.csv)

## Exercise 1

a. Read in the `USpop` data
a. Create a scatterplot of `Year` and `Population` from the `USpop` data set.
a. Fit a linear model to `USpop` with `Population` as the response and `Year` as the predictor.
a. Look at the summary of he model. Plot the model against the scatterplot.
a. Fit a quadratic regression model.
a. Use the model to predict what will happen in year 2030, 2040, and 2050. Is this realistic?

## Exercise 2

a. Read in the `presidents` data
a. Create a scatterplot of `actual` and `expected` from the `presidents` data set.
a. Fit a linear model to `presidents` with `actual` as the response and `expected` as the predictor.
a. Look at the summary of he model. Plot the model against the scatterplot. How well does the model fit?
