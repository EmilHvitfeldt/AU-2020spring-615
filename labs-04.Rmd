### Data

[HOME_SALES.csv](data/HOME_SALES.csv)

### Exercise 1

We are using the same data as last week's lab. Start by reading in the `HOME_SALES` data with `read.csv()` or `readr::read_csv()`.

a. Create a scatter plot between the finished area and the sale price.
a. Fit a linear regression model with sale price as the response and finished area as the predictor.
c. Plot the estimated regression function on top of the scatter plot. Does it appear to fit the data?
d. Predict the price for three houses that have the finished area of 2500, 4000, and 6000 square feet.
e. Use the `summary()` function to see the results of the regression analysis. What do you see?
f. Perform an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of the linear regression fit.
