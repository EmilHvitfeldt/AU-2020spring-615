[Chap. 13-14]\nAssignments and grading\nAssignments (35%): During the semester I will assign, collect, and grade assignments. You may receive assistance from other students in the class and me, but your submissions must be composed of your own thoughts, coding, and words. A typical homework will include a few problems to do by hand, to see how things work, and a few realistic problems to do using R. Late submission is accepted at a cost of a 5% deduction for each day, with a maximum deduction of 50%.\nLabs (20%): 30-45 minute labs at the end of each class. Each lab covers the material of the lecture. You will have to submit the solutions of each lab on Blackboard the Sunday after each class.\nMidterm (15%): The midterm covers several chapters of the material and it is take home. You will have three days to complete the exam.\nProject (25%) (20% report 5% presentation): Each student will receive or choose a data set with data description, problem formulation, and instructions. Using sound statistical methods, you will do the necessary modeling and data analysis and write a report summarizing your results and answering specific questions of your project. A 10-minute presentation summarizing the report will be given to the class or submitted on Blackboard.\n90 – 100 % = A\n87 – 90 % = A-\n83 – 87 % = B+\n80 – 83 % = B\n77 – 80 % = B-\n73 – 77 = C+\n70 – 73 % = C\n60 – 70 % = C-\nPlease schedule a meeting with me if you would like to see or discuss your grade at any point during the semester.\nLearning objectives\n(Acknowledgement: Thank you, Professor Jun Lu!)\nThe learning objective of this course is to give you the main concepts and a working knowledge of regression techniques that are routinely used to analyze different types of data. At the end of this course, you are expected to be able to: - Identify studies and data sets where regression can be used to address the questions of interest. - Use software to graphically display regression data. - Propose a regression model to address the research questions in a study. - Understand the principle of the Least Squares Estimation. - Use software to conduct regression analysis. This includes variable selection, parameter estimation, diagnostics, and prediction. - Interpret and summarize the results of regression analysis results in the context of the study. - Understand limitations of the regression analysis. - Design and conduct a study to investigate a research problem using real-world data and regression analysis. - Derive the least squares estimators for linear regression. - Write the linear regression model in matrix form. - Understand matrix derivations for estimation, testing, and model building in multiple linear regression.\nOnline help\nData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately, there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nIf you use Twitter, post R-related questions, and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot,” but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”).\nAdditionally, we have a class chatroom at Slack where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. Ask questions about the readings, assignments, and project. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other people’s questions too.\nSoftware\nWe will be using R in this class. While not required, it is highly recommended that you use an IDE for R, I recommend https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.\nLearning during a pandemic\nLife absolutely sucks right now. None of us is really okay. We’re all just pretending.\nYou most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities—you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).\nI’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency are intensified.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nIf you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to me! I will work with you. I promise.\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student-athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018, by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or AU police (202 885-2527).\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or find appropriate contact information for Counseling Center.\nSupport Services\nEmergency preparedness\nIn the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Web site http: //www.american.edu/emergency and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information. In case of a prolonged closure of the University, I send updates to you by email and will post all announcements on Blackboard.\nMathematics & Statistics Tutoring Lab (Don Myers Building)\nprovides tutoring in Intermediate Mathematics and Statistics. http://www.american.edu/cas/mathstat/tutoring.cfm\nAcademic Support and Access Center\noffers study skills workshops, individual instruction, tutor referrals, Supplemental Instruction, writing support, and technical and practical support and assistance with accommodations for students with physical, medical, or psychological disabilities. Writing support is also available in the Writing Center, Battelle-Tompkins 228.\nCenter for Diversity & Inclusion (X3651, MGC 201)\nis dedicated to enhancing LGBTQ, Multicultural, First Generation, and Women’s experiences on campus and to advance AU’s commitment to respecting & valuing diversity by serving as a resource and liaison to students, staff, and faculty on issues of equity through education, outreach, and advocacy.\nThe Office of Advocacy Services for Interpersonal and Sexual Violence (X7070)\nprovides free and confidential advocacy services for anyone in the campus community who is impacted by sexual violence (sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, and stalking).\nCounseling Center (x3500)\noffers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus mental health resources. Academic Support and Access Center (x3360) offers study skills workshops, individual instruction, tutor referrals, Supplemental Instruction, writing support, and technical and practical support and assistance with accommodations for students with physical, medical, or psychological disabilities.\nReligious Holidays\nStudents may receive accommodation in the course for the observance of a religious and/or cultural holiday. The student should notify the professor as soon as possible should such a need exist. More information about accommodations for religious and/or cultural holidays can be found at www.american.edu/ocl/kay/request-for-religious-accommodation.cfm.\nAcademic Integrity Code\nPlease be sure that you are familiar with AU’s Academic Integrity Code, as I am required to report any cases of academic dishonesty to the dean of CAS. For your review: http://www.american.edu/academics/ integrity/.\n\n\n\n",
