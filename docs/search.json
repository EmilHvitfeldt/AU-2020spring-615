      "contents": "\nLearning goals\nGet acquainted with R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course to analyze data as well as to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course.\nAppreciate the value of visualization in exploring the relationship between variables.\nStart using R for building plots and calculating summary statistics.\nTerminology\nWe’ve already thrown around a few new terms, so let’s define them before we proceed.\nR: Name of the programming language we will be using throughout the course.\nRStudio: An integrated development environment for R. In other words, a convenient interface for writing and running R code.\nI like to think of R as the engine of the car, and RStudio is the dashboard.\nStarting slow\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nAnd to make versioning simpler, this is a solo lab. Additionally, we want to make sure everyone gets a significant amount of time at the steering wheel.\nGetting started\nDownload R\nIf you don’t have R installed.\nGo to the CRAN and download R, make sure you get the version that matches your operating system.\nIf you have R installed\nIf you have R installed run the following code\n\n\nR.version\n\n\n               _                           \nplatform       x86_64-apple-darwin17.0     \narch           x86_64                      \nos             darwin17.0                  \nsystem         x86_64, darwin17.0          \nstatus                                     \nmajor          4                           \nminor          0.2                         \nyear           2020                        \nmonth          06                          \nday            22                          \nsvn rev        78730                       \nlanguage       R                           \nversion.string R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)\nnickname       Taking Off Again            \n\nThis should tell you what version of R you are currently using. If your R version is lower then 3.6.0 I would strongly recommend updating. In general it is a good idea to update your R version, unless you have a project right now that depend on a specific version of R.\nDownload RStudio\nWe recommend using RStudio as your IDE if you don’t already have it installed. You can go to the RStudio website to download and install the software.\nLaunch RStudio\nYou can also open the RStudio application first and then create a project by going file -> new project...\nCreate a new Rmarkdown file\nfile -> new file -> R markdown...\nHello RStudio!\nRStudio is comprised of four panes.\nOn the bottom left is the Console, this is where you can write code that will be evaluated. Try typing 2 + 2 here and hit enter, what do you get?\nOn the bottom right is the Files pane, as well as other panes that will come handy as we start our analysis.\nIf you click on a file, it will open in the editor, on the top left pane.\nFinally, the top right pane shows your Environment. If you define a variable it would show up there. Try typing x <- 2 in the Console and hit enter, what do you get in the Environment pane?\nPackages\nR is an open-source language, and developers contribute functionality to R via packages. In this lab we will work with three packages: palmerpenguins which contains the dataset, and tidyverse which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a “tidy” way.\nLoad these packages by running the following in the Console.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t installed these packages yet and R complains, then you can install these packages by running the following command. (Note that R package names are case-sensitive)\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"palmerpenguins\"))\n\n\n\nNote that the packages are also loaded with the same commands in your R Markdown document.\nWarm up\nBefore we introduce the data, let’s warm up with some simple exercises.\nThe top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\nYAML\nOpen the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.\nData\nThe data frame we will be working with today is called penguins and it’s in the palmerpenguins package.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins\n\n\n\ncount the number of species and islands with dplyr::count()\nVisualize the distribution of body_mass_g with ggplot\n\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\nLook at the correlation between body_mass_g and some of the other variables\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(body_mass_g, ___)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nModeling\nFit a linear model using parsnip to model body_mass_g\n\nlm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%\n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nlm_fit <- lm_spec %>%\n  fit(___ ~ species + island + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm, \n      data = penguins)\n\nlm_fit\n\nGet parameter estimates:\n\n\ntidy(lm_fit)\n\n\n\nFigures\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like you to do two more things:\n\nResize your figures:\nClick on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select “Output Options…” in the dropdown menu. In the pop up dialogue box go to the Figures tab and change the height and width of the figures, and hit OK when done. Then, knit your document and see how you like the new sizes. Change and knit again and again until you’re happy with the figure sizes. Note that these values get saved in the YAML.\n\nYou can also use different figure sizes for different figures. To do so click on the gear icon within the chunk where you want to make a change. Changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: fig.width and fig.height. You can change them by defining different values directly in your R Markdown document as well.\n\nChange the look of your report:\nOnce again click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select “Output Options…” in the dropdown menu. In the General tab of the pop up dialogue box try out different syntax highlighting and theme options. Hit OK and knit your document to see how it looks. Play around with these until you’re happy with the look.\nOptional\nIf you have time you can explore the different ways you can add styling to your rmarkdown document.\nHere is a cheatsheet\nand a markdown cheatsheet\nThis set of lab exersixes have been adopted from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s class Introduction to Data Science.\n\n\n\n",

For two-sample problems, use the F-test to decide which t-test to use.\n(8 points) The manufacturer of a certain brand of household light bulbs claims that the bulbs produced by his factory have an average life of at least 2,000 hours. The mean and standard deviation of 20 light bulbs selected from the manufacturer’s production process were calculated to be 2,160 and 142 hours, respectively.\nDo the data represent sufficient evidence to support the manufacturer’s claim? How can you interpret your answer.\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval for the mean lifetime of household light bulbs.\n\n(8 points) There are two manufacturing processes, old and new, that produce the same product. The defect rate has been measured for 20 days for the old process, and for 14 days for the new process, resulting in the following sample summaries.\n\nOLD\nNEW\nAverage defect rate\n4.7\n2.3\nStandard deviation\n6.8\n5.0\nThe firm is interested in switching to the new process only if it can be demonstrated convincingly that the new process reduces the defect rate. Is there significant evidence of that? Use \\(\\alpha = 5%\\); assume that the collected data represent two random samples from Normal distributions. Use the method of testing that is appropriate for this situation.\n(9 points) An account on server A is more expensive than an account on server B. However, server A is faster. To see if whether it’s optimal to go with the faster but more expensive server, a manager needs to know how much faster it is. A certain computer algorithm is executed 30 times on server A and 20 times on server B with the following results,\n\nServer A\nServer B\nSample mean\n6.7 min\n7.5 min\nSample standard deviation\n0.6 min\n1.2 min\nIs there a significant difference between the two servers?\nIs server A significantly faster?\nState the null and alternative hypotheses, use the data to select the most appropriate procedure, and conduct the test. What assumptions are we making for this test to be valid?\n(10 points) Data on 522 recent home sales are available here.

[Chap. 13-14]\nAssignments and grading\nAssignments (35%): During the semester I will assign, collect, and grade assignments. You may receive assistance from other students in the class and me, but your submissions must be composed of your own thoughts, coding, and words. A typical homework will include a few problems to do by hand, to see how things work, and a few realistic problems to do using R. Late submission is accepted at a cost of a 5% deduction for each day, with a maximum deduction of 50%.\nLabs (20%): 30-45 minute labs at the end of each class. Each lab covers the material of the lecture. You will have to submit the solutions of each lab on Blackboard the Sunday after each class.\nMidterm (15%): The midterm covers several chapters of the material and it is take home. You will have three days to complete the exam.\nProject (25%) (20% report 5% presentation): Each student will receive or choose a data set with data description, problem formulation, and instructions. Using sound statistical methods, you will do the necessary modeling and data analysis and write a report summarizing your results and answering specific questions of your project. A 10-minute presentation summarizing the report will be given to the class or submitted on Blackboard.\n90 – 100 % = A\n87 – 90 % = A-\n83 – 87 % = B+\n80 – 83 % = B\n77 – 80 % = B-\n73 – 77 = C+\n70 – 73 % = C\n60 – 70 % = C-\nPlease schedule a meeting with me if you would like to see or discuss your grade at any point during the semester.\nLearning objectives\n(Acknowledgement: Thank you, Professor Jun Lu!)\nThe learning objective of this course is to give you the main concepts and a working knowledge of regression techniques that are routinely used to analyze different types of data. At the end of this course, you are expected to be able to: - Identify studies and data sets where regression can be used to address the questions of interest. - Use software to graphically display regression data. - Propose a regression model to address the research questions in a study. - Understand the principle of the Least Squares Estimation. - Use software to conduct regression analysis. This includes variable selection, parameter estimation, diagnostics, and prediction. - Interpret and summarize the results of regression analysis results in the context of the study. - Understand limitations of the regression analysis. - Design and conduct a study to investigate a research problem using real-world data and regression analysis. - Derive the least squares estimators for linear regression. - Write the linear regression model in matrix form. - Understand matrix derivations for estimation, testing, and model building in multiple linear regression.\nOnline help\nData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately, there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nIf you use Twitter, post R-related questions, and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot,” but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”).\nAdditionally, we have a class chatroom at Slack where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. Ask questions about the readings, assignments, and project. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other people’s questions too.\nSoftware\nWe will be using R in this class. While not required, it is highly recommended that you use an IDE for R, I recommend https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.\nLearning during a pandemic\nLife absolutely sucks right now. None of us is really okay. We’re all just pretending.\nYou most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities—you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).\nI’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency are intensified.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nIf you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to me! I will work with you. I promise.\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student-athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018, by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or AU police (202 885-2527).\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or find appropriate contact information for Counseling Center.\nSupport Services\nEmergency preparedness\nIn the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Web site http: //www.american.edu/emergency and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information. In case of a prolonged closure of the University, I send updates to you by email and will post all announcements on Blackboard.\nMathematics & Statistics Tutoring Lab (Don Myers Building)\nprovides tutoring in Intermediate Mathematics and Statistics. http://www.american.edu/cas/mathstat/tutoring.cfm\nAcademic Support and Access Center\noffers study skills workshops, individual instruction, tutor referrals, Supplemental Instruction, writing support, and technical and practical support and assistance with accommodations for students with physical, medical, or psychological disabilities. Writing support is also available in the Writing Center, Battelle-Tompkins 228.\nCenter for Diversity & Inclusion (X3651, MGC 201)\nis dedicated to enhancing LGBTQ, Multicultural, First Generation, and Women’s experiences on campus and to advance AU’s commitment to respecting & valuing diversity by serving as a resource and liaison to students, staff, and faculty on issues of equity through education, outreach, and advocacy.\nThe Office of Advocacy Services for Interpersonal and Sexual Violence (X7070)\nprovides free and confidential advocacy services for anyone in the campus community who is impacted by sexual violence (sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, and stalking).\nCounseling Center (x3500)\noffers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus mental health resources. Academic Support and Access Center (x3360) offers study skills workshops, individual instruction, tutor referrals, Supplemental Instruction, writing support, and technical and practical support and assistance with accommodations for students with physical, medical, or psychological disabilities.\nReligious Holidays\nStudents may receive accommodation in the course for the observance of a religious and/or cultural holiday. The student should notify the professor as soon as possible should such a need exist. More information about accommodations for religious and/or cultural holidays can be found at www.american.edu/ocl/kay/request-for-religious-accommodation.cfm.\nAcademic Integrity Code\nPlease be sure that you are familiar with AU’s Academic Integrity Code, as I am required to report any cases of academic dishonesty to the dean of CAS.
