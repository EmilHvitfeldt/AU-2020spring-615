This post shows how to obtain a confidence interval by hand.

Example: Obtain $95%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ having 

$$n = 10 \qquad \bar{Y} = 20 \qquad s = 4$$

We have that the confidence interval for $\mu$ is 

$$\bar{Y} \pm t(1-\sigma/2;n-1)s\{\bar{Y}\}$$

First we use that $s\{\bar{Y}\} = \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \dfrac{4}{\sqrt{10}} = 1.265$

Since we are looking for a $95%$ confidence interval we get that $$
\begin{align*}
1-\sigma &= 0.95 \\
\sigma &= 0.05 \\
\end{align*}
$$

So we plug this into the t distribution. The results that either be found in a [lookup book](https://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/business-stat/StatistialTables.pdf) or by using R `qt(1 - 0.05 / 2, 10 - 1)`

$$t(1 - 0.05/2; 10 -1) = 2.262$$

We now have all we need to calculate everything

$$20 \pm 2.262 \cdot 1.265$$

giving us the confidence interval

$$17.139 \le \mu \le 22.861$$
