# Linear Regression with one Predictor Variable

Definition

&gt; Regression analysis is a statistical methodology that utilizes the relation between two or more quantitative variables so that a response variable can be predicted from the others

response, outcome, dependent variables

predictors, independent variables, features, or variables

---

Examples

&gt; Sales of a product predicted by the amount of advertising spent

&gt; Amount of rain predicted by hours of rain

---

# Relationos between variables

- Functional relation
- Statistical Relation

---

# Functional Relation

Is expression by a mathematical formula

`$$Y = f(X)$$`

where `\(f\)` is a function mapping `\(X\)` to `\(Y\)`.

---

# Functional Relation

.pull-left[
Case:

Money made (Y) of a product sold at a fixed price and the number of units sold (X)

Price of unit: 2  

The functional relation will be

$$ Y = 4X $$
]

.pull-right[

]

---

# Statistical Relation

We don't have a perfect relation between the variables

In other words, the points will not always fall on the line

The relationship between the response and predictors can strong or weak depending on the case

---

# Statistical Relation

.pull-left[
Case:

mid-year and year-end performance for employees

The Statistical relation will be

$$ Y = X + \varepsilon $$

Notice how the relationship is not perfect

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

# Statistical Relation

.pull-left[
The scattering of the points represents **variation** in the year-end performance that is not associated with the mid-year performance

# Statistical Relation

.pull-left[
The scattering of the points represents **variation** in the year-end performance that is not associated with the mid-year performance

And it can be a **small** amount of variation

# Sneak peek: More than one predictor variable

Example: Study of short children

.pull-left[
`\(X_1\)`: Age  
`\(X_2\)`: Gender
`\(X_3\)`: Height
`\(X_4\)`: Weight

`\(Y\)`: Peak plasma growth hormone level
]

--

.pull-right[
There is a probability distribution of Y for each level of `\(X_i\)`
]

# Construction of Regression models

1. Selection of predictor variables (more about this in chapter 9)
1. Functional form of regression relation
1. Scope of Model, must be generalizable

---

# Use of regression Analysis

1. Description/Inference
1. Control
1. Prediction

---

# Regression and Causality

The existence of a statistical relation between the response variable Y and the predictor X does not imply that Y depends on X

Example:

X: Size of vocabulary
Y: Writing speed of children

Will show a positive statistical relation

This does not imply that an increase in vocabulary causes a faster writing speed

What is more likely is that a 3rd variable such as "age of the child" positively affects both

---

# Regression and Causality

This should not mean that statistical relations never have a causal link, but that we need to spend a little more time with the problem to infer that there is one

---

# Notation

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i $$

`\(Y_i\)` Value of response variable at the `\(i\)`th observation

`\(\beta_0, \beta_1\)` parameters (1 value each)

`\(X_i\)` Value of response variable at the `\(i\)`th observation

`\(\varepsilon_i\)` Random error at `\(i\)`th observation

`\(\varepsilon\)` is the random error term with mean `\(E\{\varepsilon_i\} = 0\)` and `\(V\{\varepsilon_i\} = \sigma^2\)`

The different error terms are uncorrelated

---

# Notation

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i $$
We say that `\(Y\)` denotes a random variable and `\(y\)` denotes a potential value of that random variable

---

# Some observations

1. `\(Y_i\)` is the sum of `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i\)` which is constant and the random term `\(\varepsilon\)`, hence `\(Y_i\)` is a random variable.
1. `\(E\{\varepsilon\} = 0\)` then `\(E\{Y_i\} = E\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon\} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i\)`
1. `\(V\{Y_i\} = V\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon\} = V\{\varepsilon_i\} = \sigma^2\)`
1. `\(Y_i\)` and `\(Y_j\)` are uncorrelated since the error terms are uncorrelated

---

# Example

&gt; Relationship between the number of bids requested for contractors during a week and the time required to prepare the bids

Let the regression model be

`$$Y_i = 9.5 + 2.1X_i + \varepsilon_i$$`
for i representing different weeks

Y: Number of hours required to prepare bids

X: Number of bids prepared in a week

---

# Example

&gt; Relationship between the number of bids requested for contractors during a week and the time required to prepare the bids

The regression function for this model is

$$ E\{Y\} = 9.5 + 2.1X $$

If we suppose that the `\(i\)`th week, `\(X_i = 45\)` then we would expect the number of hours spent preparing to be 104. But if the actual number of hours `\(Y_i = 108\)` then the error is `\(\varepsilon_i = 4\)`

`\(\varepsilon_i\)` is the deviation or `\(Y_i\)` from its mean value `\(E\{Y_i\}\)`

---

# Meaning of Regression Parameters

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i $$

`\(\beta_1\)`: Slope of the regression line. It indicates the change in the mean of the probability distribution of Y per unit increase in X.

`\(\beta_0\)`: `\(Y\)` intercept of the regression line. When `\(X = 0\)` gives mean of probability distribution of `\(Y\)`.

---

# Estimation of Regression Function

The data will be used to estimate the parameters of the regression function.

We will think of the observations `\((X, Y)\)` as consisting of the pair of numbers

$$ (X_1, Y_1),  (X_2, Y_2), ..., (X_n, Y_n) $$

---

# Method of least squares

We use the method of least squares (MLS) to effectively estimate `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`

---

# Method of least squares

# Method of least squares

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Method of least squares

The error is

$$ Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i)$$

so we want to minimize


$$ Q = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i))^2 $$
This can be done in 2 ways:

- Numerical search procedure
- Analytical procedures

---

# Method of least squares

Since we have

`$$Q = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i))^2$$`

that means that `\(Q\)` is a function of `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`. 

To estimate `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` we can take the partial derivatives of `\(Q\)` with respect to `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`.

---

# Method of least squares

`$$\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0 } = -2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i) = 0 \rightarrow \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Y_i - n\beta_0-\beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i = 0 \quad (1)$$`

`$$\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_1 } = -2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i) X_i = 0 \rightarrow \sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i Y_i - \beta_0 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i -\beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i^2 = 0 \quad (2)$$`

---

# Method of least squares

`$$(1) \rightarrow n\beta_0 = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Y_i-\beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i \rightarrow \beta_0 = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{Y_i}{n}-\beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{X_i}{n}$$`

So `\(b_0 = \bar{Y} = \beta_1 \bar{X}\)`.

---

# Method of least squares

And we will see in chapter 2 that

we can rearrange the terms in `\((2)\)` that

`$$b_1 = \dfrac{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}$$`

---

# Properties of Least Squares Estimators

1. **Unbiased property** `\(E\{b_1\} = \beta_1\)` and `\(E\{b_0\} = \beta_0\)`
1. **Variance** it can be shown that `\(b_0, b_1\)` gives the minimum variance in the group of linear and unbiased estimators.

These two points are part of the Gauss-Markov theorem

---

# Point estimator of Mean Response

Given `\(b_0\)` and `\(b_1\)` of the parameters in the regression function

`$$E\{Y_i\} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$$`

We estimate the regression as follows

`$$\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X$$`

Also `\(\hat{Y}\)` is unbiased with minimum variance

Which means that

`$$\hat{Y_i} = b_0 + b_1 X_i, \quad i = 1, ..., n$$`

---

# Residuals

The `\(i\)`th residual is denoted by `\(e_i\)` and is defined as

`$$e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$$`

For the regression model 

`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$`

the residual `\(e_i\)` is defined as

`$$e_i = Y_i - (b_0 + b_1 X_i) = Y_i - b_0 - b_1 X_i$$`

---

# Residuals

`\(\varepsilon_i = Y_i - E\{Y_i\}\)` is the vertical deviation of $Y_i% from the unknown true regression line

`\(e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}\)` is the vertical deviation of `\(Y_i\)` from the fitted value `\(\hat{Y_i}\)` on the estimated regression line and is thus known

Residuals are useful for studying whether a given regression model is appropriate for the data at hand (chapter 3)

---

# Properties of the fitted regression line

1. Sum of residuals is zero

`$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n e_i = 0$$`
1. The sum of the squred residuals is minimum.
1. `\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^nY_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\hat{Y}_i\)`

---

# Properties of the fitted regression line

1. `\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^nX_ie_i = 0\)`
1. `\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\hat{Y}_ie_i = 0\)`
1. The regression line goes through `\((\hat{X}, \hat{Y})\)`

---

# Estimationn of Error Terms Variance 

The variance `\(\sigma^2\)` of `\(\varepsilon_i\)` needs to be estimated to obtain an indication of the variability of the probability distribution of `\(Y\)`

The variance of a single population is estimated by sample variance `\(s^2\)`

`$$s^2 = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\dfrac{(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}{(n-1)}$$`

---

# Estimationn of Error Terms Variance

Similar to estimators for `\(\sigma^2\)` for the regression model we have

`$$e_i = Y_i = \hat{Y}_i$$`
since `\(Y_i\)` come fromo different distributions the sum of squares `\(SSE\)` is

`$$SSE = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 =  \sum\limits_{i=1}^n e_i^2$$`

Now we know that `\(SSE\)` has `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom.

---

# Estimationn of Error Terms Variance

Two degrees of freedom are lost because both `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` need to be estimated in obtaining the estimated means `\(\hat{Y}_i\)`, hence

`$$s^2 = MSE = \dfrac{SSE}{n-2} = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n-2}$$`

where `\(MSE\)` = error mean square

It can be shown that `\(E\{s^2\} = E\{MSE\} = \sigma^2\)` of the regression model

`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$`

---

# Confidence intervals

Let `\(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n\)` be a random sample of `\(n\)` observations from a normal population with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`.

.pull-left[
The sample mean is: `\(\bar{Y} = \dfrac{\sum^n_{i=1}Y}{n}\)`

The sample sd is: `\(s = \left[ \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}{n-1} \right]^{1/2}\)`
]

.pull-right[
We then get that

`$$\bar{Y} \sim \mu_{\bar{Y}} = \mu \quad \&amp; \quad \sigma_{\bar{y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$`
]

---

# Confidence intervals

Thus the estimates standard deviation is `\(s\{\bar{Y}\} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)`

We define `\(\dfrac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{s\{\bar{Y}\}}\)` t-distributed with `\(n-1\)` degrees of freedom

The confidence interval for `\(\mu\)` are

`$$\bar{Y} \pm t(1 - \alpha/2, n-1)s\{\bar{Y}\}$$`
