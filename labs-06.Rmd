### Data

[CH01PR19.txt](data/CH01PR19.txt)

### Exercise 1

Start by reading in the data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.table("data/CH01PR19.txt", col.names = c("Y", "X"))
```

And fit a simple linear regression model with $Y$ as the response and $X$ as the predictor.

a. Look at the regression model with `summary()`, write what you see.
b. Use the `confint()` function to get the confidence interval of the two parameter estimates. What happens to the width of the interval if we set `level = 0.99`. Explain.
c. Use the predict function to predict the expected value of $Y$ when $X = 3$. Also obtain the confidence interval and prediction interval.
d. Extract the regression residuals and confirm that $\sum^n_{i = 1} \varepsilon_i = 0$ and $\sum^n_{i = 1} \left(\varepsilon_i X_i\right) = 0$
e. Perform an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Explain what you see, does it match up with what we saw earlier?
