### Data

[HOME_SALES.csv](data/HOME_SALES.csv)

### Exercise 1

Start by downloading and reading in the `HOME_SALES` data with `read.csv()` or `readr::read_csv()`.

a) **A one-sample T-test**

There is a claim that the average price of homes in the region is #300,000. Does the data set support of disprove the claim?

b) **A one-sample, left-tail T-test**

Is the mean price less than $300,000?

c) **A one-sample, right-tail T-test**

Is there any evidence that the mean price is *above* $300,000?

### Exercise 2 - A two-sample T-test

Does the sales price depend on the presence of a pool?

### Exercise 3 - A two-sample F-test of variances

How does the variance of sales prices with presence of a pool relate with the variance of sales prices without presence of a pool

### Exercise 4 - Parallel boxplots

Visualize the boxplots of the two samples using parallel boxplots.
